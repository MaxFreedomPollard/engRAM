Done. engRAM is installed and your vault is unlocked (it stays unlocked
through logins until the next restart, then asks for your passphrase once).

To use it with Hermes:
  1. python -m pip install --user engram-vault    # into the Hermes venv if separate
  2. Copy-Item -Recurse integrations\engram `$env:USERPROFILE\.hermes\plugins\engram
  3. hermes memory setup      # pick "engram" in the list

Verify anytime:  engram selftest
