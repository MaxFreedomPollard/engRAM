"""Deciding what to remember, and how strongly — offline, deterministic.

Policy (Nucleus remembers aggressively, and prioritizes the user + their
machine over world trivia):

* STORE NEARLY EVERYTHING. The only turns dropped are genuinely empty ones.
  Every answer the user gives — yes, no, "ok", a number, a preference, an
  opinion, a stray fact — is information and is stored. A bare "OK" in reply
  to "Can I edit the registry?" is a consent decision, often the most
  important thing in the whole session; it is captured together with the
  question that produced it (see integrations resolving prior_question).

* IMPORTANCE TIERS drive recall ranking (search boosts higher-importance
  memories), so completeness never buries what matters:
    0.90  decision / consent / explicit "remember this"
    0.80  personal facts and preferences (about the user)
    0.75  the user's machine / environment / configuration
    0.55  other substantive statements (incl. world facts the user states)
    0.20  pure social pleasantries ("thanks", "lol") — kept, ranked last

* DEDUP is exact-match only (Vault.store's 0.97 cosine guard). We do NOT
  drop "near-duplicates": a second yes/no to a *different* question is new
  information, and its stored text (which includes the question) is not a
  near-duplicate anyway.

Nucleus still never calls an LLM — the host model curates explicitly via
nucleus_store / nucleus_forget when it wants to distill or delete.
