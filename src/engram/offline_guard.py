"""Runtime offline enforcement (invariant I1).

When activated (ENGRAM_ASSERT_OFFLINE=1 or --assert-offline), creating any
INET/INET6 socket raises OfflineViolation and the process aborts loudly.
stdio (the MCP transport) needs no sockets, so normal operation is
unaffected. The ONLY code allowed to bypass this is nothing: even
`setup download-model` refuses to run while the guard is active.
